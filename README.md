Please refer to the file `tables.pdf`.

- Table 1-3 present the score computation of `TCA` for solving CCAG with covering stenght between 2-4.

- Table 4 and 5 compare `TCA-opt` with `TCA` for 2-way and 3-way CCAG.

- Table 6-8 compare `FastCA` against its competitors for 2-4 way CCAG.

- Table 9 present the experimental results about alternative versions of `FastCA` on 3-way real-world instances.
